# Vector.AI Coding challenge

To clearly explain every step of the process I decided to use a self-contained Jupyter Notebook. The Notebook was already executed so no direct execution is necessary, however, the commands to install the needed libraries are at the top of the notebook and can be uncommented if needed.

The notebook can be found [HERE](Vector.ai%20coding%20challenge.ipynb)
